# SilverStripe Recipes

Some SilverStripe code is too small to be worth a module, but complex enough that sharing solutions is a good idea

The most important recipes live sapphire/docs and appear on doc.silverstripe.org. But only the best, most useful recipes
get to live there. Also as a non core developer it's quite hard to add a new one.

This is where the less important ones live :) Fork this repo, add your own recipies, mix it up.

After a recipe has become stable, it might be graduated to sapphire/doc

# Codebase organisation

Ideally everything will be php files with comments at the top explaining what they do. If you find yourself writing a seperate documentation
file, you probably want a module not just a recipie
